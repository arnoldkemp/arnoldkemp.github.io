# The Process of Dying

So you've just taken some lethal damage, huh?  Well you've come to the right place.

## Keep Your Eyes Open

First, any damage in excess of your HP is applied to your Constitution.  If you aren't taking any Con damage right now, you're on the wrong place; back into the sunlight for you.

Now make a Con check.

| Roll | Result |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical Success | Adrenaline Rush.  Choose: recover 1d6 HP or make a free melee attack against your attacker. |
| Success | Choose: prone or disarmed.  Gain a cool scar. |
| Failure | Dying.  Gain a gruesome scar (if you survive). |
| Critical Failure | Instant, messy death.  Say your last words. |

If you fail by more than 10 points, that also counts as a Critical Failure.

## Dying

At the start of every turn, make a Con check.  If you fail, you lose another point of Con.  If you get a natural 1, you improve to Stabilized.

## Resuscitating

An ally can attempt to staunch your blood.  In order to Stabilize you, they must succeed on an Int/2 check, or some sort of appropriate skill check.  'First Aid' would be a appropriate skill here.  If you were ripped open by a dragon, then the 'dragon' skill would also be appropriate here.  If your player makes a clever suggestion, allow it (once).

Any magical healing will also Stabilize you.

## Stabilized

You are unconscious at 0 HP.  You will regain consciousness in 1d6 minutes.  When you do, roll on the Mutilation Matrix (below) to see how bad it is.

If the result is preceded by the word 'Injury', that means that the condition lasts until the character takes a Vacation.
