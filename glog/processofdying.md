# The Process of Dying

So you've just taken some lethal damage, huh?  Well you've come to the right page.

## Keep Your Eyes Open

First, any damage in excess of your HP is applied to your Constitution.  If you aren't taking any Con damage right now, you're on the wrong place; back into the sunlight for you.

Now make a Con check.

| Roll | Result |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical Success | Adrenaline Rush.  Choose: recover 1d6 HP or make a free melee attack against your attacker. |
| Success | Choose: prone or disarmed.  Gain a cool scar. |
| Failure | Dying.  Gain a gruesome scar (if you survive). |
| Critical Failure | Instant, messy death.  Say your last words. |

If you fail by more than 10 points, that also counts as a Critical Failure.

The player decides what a cool scar looks like.  The DM decides what a gruesome scar looks like.  

## Dying

Unconscious on the floor.  You will either Stabilize or die.  At the start of every turn, make a Con check.  

| Roll | Result |
|------------------|---------------|
| Critical Success | Stabilize. |
| Success | No change. |
| Failure | Lose 1 Con. |
| Critical Failure | Lose 1d6 Con. |

If your Con ever drops to 0, you die.

## Stabilizing an Ally

If your ally is Dying, you can attempt to Stabilize them.  This requires you to succeed on an Int/2 check, or some sort of appropriate skill check.  

'First Aid' would be a appropriate skill (unless the damage was psychic or very unusual).  If you were ripped open by a dragon, then the 'dragon' skill would also be appropriate here.  If your player makes a clever suggestion on how to use a skill, allow it (once).

Anything that causes you to gain HP will also cause you to Stabilize.

## Stabilized

You are unconscious at 0 HP.  You will regain consciousness in 1d6 minutes.  When you do, roll on the Mutilation Matrix (below) to see how bad it is.  Remember that your Maximum HP is affected by your Con score, so your maximum HP is probably lower.

## Mutilation Matrix

| Roll | Result |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Stood Before the Gate.  Speak with dead 1/day. |
| 2 | Reaper's Eye.  Lose an eye.  Learn a creature's current HP 1/day. |
| 3 | Death Debt.  An NPC has cheated Death.  You must kill them in 7 days or you will die. |
| 4-10 | Gain 1 Trauma. |
| 11 | Throat or Jaw.  Cannot speak louder than a whisper. |
| 12 | Blind.  2-in-6 chance to be permanent.  Lasts 24 hours otherwise. |
| 13 | Deaf.  2-in-6 chance to be permanent.  Lasts 24 hours otherwise. |
| 14 | Disabled L Hand.  Vacation heals 2-in-6. |
| 15 | Disabled R Hand.  Vacation heals 2-in-6. |
| 16 | Disabled Arm.  Vacation heals 2-in-6. |
| 17 | Disabled Foot.  Vacation heals 2-in-6. |
| 18 | Disabled Leg.  Vacation heals 2-in-6. |
| 19 | Paraplegic or Quadriplegic (50% each).  Vacation heals 4-in-6. |
| 20 | Coma.  Vacation heals 4-in-6. |

Gruesome scars should be tailored to the injury: a character who is blinded by the Mutilation Matrix (even temporarily) should lose an eye.  Deafness should be accompanied by a missing ear.  Concussions caused by swords will probably also leave a bald patch.  An injured foot means 1d3 lost toes, and if the injury becomes permanent, it means that the foot became gangrenous and had to be taken off, too.

For specific types of injuries, certain entries on the Mutilation Matrix are replaced.

### Fire and Acid

Replace entries 11-20 with: Burned.  Cannot wear armor.  Vacation heals.

### Frostbite

Replace entries 11-20 with: Frostbite.  -4 Movement.  Cannot perform delicate tasks.  Vacation heals.

### Lightning

Replace entries 11-20 with: Nerve Damage.  Your HP total is now a secret known only to the DM.  Vacation heals.

### Weird

Replace entries 11-20 with: Cursed.  You gain the most thematically-appropriate Curse, or a random Curse.

### Death Magic

Replaced entries 11-20 with: Withering.  You permanently lose 1d4 points from a random physical ability score.  (Gruesome scar replaced by white hair.)

Breakdowns

If someone is reassuring you and trying to calm you down, they can make a Cha check every 10 minutes to end your Breakdown.  Otherwise, it lasts 1d6 x 10 minutes.
