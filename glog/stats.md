# Stats

These are all the numeric variables on your character sheet.  Let's go through them all.

## Experience Points (XP)

Every silver piece you get in an adventurous manner gives you +1 XP.  These can be looted, stolen, or gained through adventurous questing. XP is never gained through commerce, employment, or robbing the helpless.  XP is only ever gained from treasure: coinage, precious metals, jewels, art, and trade goods.  Magic items are never worth more than 500 XP.

The party also earns XP whenever they make a new ally, because friends are a form of wealth.  The reward depends on the influence of their new ally.  500 XP for a wizard, 100 XP for a fishmonger.

At the end of the session, the earned XP is divided up and awarded to all members of the party.  Every time a character accumulates 2000 XP, they gain a level.  

There's no expected rate of XP gain (a lot depends on the adventure and the adventurousness), but my players probably average about 100-200 XP per hour of gameplay, and that feels about right to me.

Variant: Choosing XP Sources

If you want to change how XP is awarded, I advise you to only award XP for the activities that need to be encouraged.

XP is not the only motivator in an RPG, but is the most visible.  New players will wonder "Where is the game?  How do I know if I am winning?" and XP provides the most obvious answer to those questions.

If you reward XP for killing enemies, players will look to get into more fights.  I don't think this is a good fit for the GLOG (or any OSR game) because the HP pools are small, death is permanent, and the dice are fickle.

## Hit Points

Hit points are best thought of as dont-get-hit points.  They represent your ability to survive potentially lethal harm via skill, luck, and sheer toughness.  When you take damage, it is subtracted from your HP points.  Damage that exceeds your HP rolls over onto your Constitution.  If you take Constitution damage this way, you must make a Con check, with failure indicating a result on the Table of Woe (which includes the possibility of instant death).

Anything that could reasonably kill an average peasant does at least 1 HP of damage.  If it doesn't pass that test (i.e. a cat) then it does not deal HP damage.

You take no penalties for being at 0 HP.  All this means is that you are now too ragged to survive anythin

Eating a solid meal will recover 1d6 hit points.  A good night's sleep and a solid breakfast will recover all of your missing hit points.
