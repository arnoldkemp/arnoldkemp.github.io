#Introduction

The GLOG is tabletop RPG system.  It is an OSR game, whatever that means.

##Assumptions {#assumptions}

I assume that you're already familiar enough with tabletop roleplaying games that I won't waste time explaining them here.

##Philosophy (#philosophy)

The GLOG was designed to follow a specific set of principles.

### 1. Hackable

There is no perfect system--each one has its flaws and merits.  And all the good ideas are not concentrated in a single system, but are spread across many.  The solution is to capture the best pieces of all of the best systems and inspirations, and then adapt them to your base ruleset.  

I expect that this will be a homebrew, but I hope that you will base it on the GLOG.

Towards this end, I have tried to strip away mechanical interdependencies and ability expectations.  Hopefully you will not encounter too many collisions as you add and subtract from these rules.

### 2. Accessible

There are no secret combos in this book.  There are no optimal builds or tiers.  A player who has studied this book should have no advantage over a neophyte sitting down at the table for the first time.

Death to system mastery.

### 3. Quick

Players should be able to roll up a new character in 5 minutes.  Rules should be explainable on the fly.  Flexibility is prioritized over comprehensiveness.  Simplicity is prioritized over realism.  Rulings are prioritized over rules.

### 4. Humble

Heroes, not superheroes.  A pack of wolves should always be threatening.  Each level beyond 3 gives diminishing returns.  The power curve quickly becomes an asymptote.  Some things will always be elusive, and perhaps impossible: resurrection, teleportation, darkvision, easy flight, water breathing.

Characters will grow in versatility more than power.  And they will eventually gain more abilities from their experiences than from leveling up.

### 5. Simple

The system should be ruthlessly simplified.  If a rule is not vital, cast it off.  Turn two rolls into one roll.  Turn one roll into none.  Turn tables into formulae.  Turn formulae into static numbers.

### 6. Compatible

The rules should never deviate too far from the oldest editions.  For better or for worse, there is a common language of hit points and ability scores, and by (more or less) maintaining compatibility with those venerable standards, the GLOG should be able to use old modules that are adapted on the fly.

Remember that maintaining compatibility is not the same thing as feeding the sacred cows.
