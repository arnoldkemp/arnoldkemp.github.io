# Introduction

This website is an evolving document where the most current rules are maintained.  It will be updated whenever I think I have a better idea about how things should be done.

I hope you like it.

## Purpose

All RPG rulebooks have multiple goals.  While these goals are not mutually exclusive, they are competitive.  A text cannot optimized for all of them at the same time: dictionaries are not textbooks.

The goals of an RPG ruleset:

1. As a **reference** for the rules, structured to be easily searchable and written to be unambiguous.
2. As a **tutorial**, structured to guide a new reader and written to be accessible.
3. As an **inspiration** that evokes the fantasy that they want to emulate, and gets people excited.

The GLOG is slightly unique in the fact that it expects its DMs to chop it up, add, subtract, and homebrew.  So the GLOG has one additional goal:

4. As **empowerment** to get DMs into about game design, so that they will feel more comfortable hacking the ruleset, and be better at their homebrew once they do.

## Sidebars

The primary text of each section will be the simplest version of the best rules (IMO), I will also include collapsed sidebars for variants, discussion, and maybe even lore.

A group that just wants to play the Orthodox GLOG will never have to open these sidebars.  

A group that has no intention of ever playing the GLOG may still find these discussions to be the most useful part of this site.  Hopefully they'll inspire revisions of the reader's own homebrew, or at least provide elements worth stealing.

  ## Rambling

  One big advantage of a website is the ability to compress large discussions into collapsed sidebars.  While I've tried to keep the rest of the document succinct, sidebars allow me to rant longer before I start feeling the guilt of inefficiency.  If you aren't interested in the concent of these sidebars, don't open them.

  <summary>Discussion: How to Disagree</summary>

  ## Disagreement

  I'm writing about RPGs on the internet: I am fully aware that you are going to disagree with me. 

  You may be correct.  The GLOG is not the best system for *everyone*.  It's not even the best system for *anyone* (except me).  It is *a* optimum, not *the* optimum.  

  So if you see an error or an omission in the GLOG, let's talk about it.  BLOG about it.  Publish something.  Put out an alternative, and explain why it is preferable.  The stuff you write will not be The Optimum either, but a specific group with a specific set of needs may find it to be exactly the sort of thing that they needed.

  So even though you may dislike the GLOG, I hope you still find something worth stealing.  (That's kind of the point.)

  The only goblin law is that there are no goblin laws.

# Philosophy

The GLOG was designed to follow a specific set of principles.  None are absolute, and they all compete with each other for consideration.  Still, they serve as both a launch pad and arbitrator.

There are two halves to this, because there are two halves to this game.  The ruleset is what you are reading right now, and refers to all of the procedural elements.  Gameplay is the methods that the DM uses to run her game, and is too flexible to rigidly codify.

(Remember that the book is not the game.)

## Ruleset Philosophy

### 1. Hackable

There is no perfect system--each one has its flaws and merits.  And all the good ideas are not concentrated in a single system, but are spread across many.  The solution is to capture the best pieces of all of the best systems and inspirations, and then adapt them to your base ruleset.  

I expect that this will be a homebrew, but I hope that you will base it on the GLOG.

Towards this end, I have tried to strip away mechanical interdependencies and ability expectations.  Hopefully you will not encounter too many collisions as you add and subtract from these rules.

### 2. Accessible

There are no secret combos in this book.  There are no optimal builds or tiers.  A player who has studied this book should have no advantage over a neophyte sitting down at the table for the first time.

Death to system mastery.

### 3. Quick

Players should be able to roll up a new character in 5 minutes.  Rules should be explainable on the fly.  Flexibility is prioritized over comprehensiveness.  Simplicity is prioritized over realism.  Rulings are prioritized over rules.

### 4. Humble

Heroes, not superheroes.  A pack of wolves should always be threatening.  Each level beyond 3 gives diminishing returns.  The power curve quickly becomes an asymptote.  

Characters will grow in versatility more than power.  And they will eventually gain more abilities from their experiences than from leveling up.

### 5. Simple

The system should be ruthlessly simplified.  If a rule is not vital, cast it off.  Turn two rolls into one roll.  Turn one roll into none.  Turn tables into formulae.  Turn formulae into static numbers.

### 6. Compatible

The rules should never deviate too far from the oldest editions.  For better or for worse, there is a common language of hit points and ability scores, and by (more or less) maintaining compatibility with those venerable standards, the GLOG should be able to use old modules that are adapted on the fly.

Remember that maintaining compatibility is not the same thing as feeding the sacred cows.

## Gameplay Philosophy

### 1. Give Them Interesting Choices

The DM describes, the players decide, and the dice resolve.

Every time the DM asks the players "so what are you going to do?" the situation should pose an interesting question.  The DM has failed if she doens't present enough information for the players to make an informed choice (two identical doors), or if she takes away their ability to choose (a trap triggers without any opportunity to notice or react).

### 2. Let Them Roll Dice

Players like rolling dice more dice.  It makes them think that they have more control.  Indulge them.  (The DM will be busy with other things.)

### 3. Let The Dice Surprise You

Don't create an adventure that follows a single path, or a fight that will only have a single outcome.  The DM should be surprised by the directions that the game takes, not just the players.  Use random tables.  Roll to find out.

### 4. Let Them Change the World

Let them be more than just rats in your maze. 

### 5. Let Them Die

Life is a privilege, not a right.  The depths of fortune are just as attainable as the heights.

Having said that, players should only be dying as a result of stupidity or terrible luck.  If that is not the case, the DM is usually to blame.  A character who drinks poison should die, but the danger of that bottle shouldn't come as a surprise to a player.

When a player dies, he should sit back in his chair and say "yeah, I guess that makes sense".

No fudging dice.  If you are unwilling to let a character die as a result of the roll, don't ask them to roll the die.

### 6. Let The Underworld Remain Perilous

No resurrection (except at a terrible cost).

No convenient teleportation (except at a terrible risk).

No darkvision or everburning torches.  Let the Darkness be always a foe.

No convenient flight.  Let the pit remain a barrier.

No permanent waterbreathing.  The water is not your home.

### 7. Talk It Out

No social skills.  No Persuasion or Intimidation.  And definitely no Bluff.

Unlike combat, we can effectively emulate conversation in our living room.
