# Introduction

This website is an evolving document where the most current rules are maintained.  It will be updated whenever I think I have a better idea about how things should be done.

I hope you like it.

## Purpose

All RPG rulebooks have multiple goals.  While these goals are not mutually exclusive, they are competitive.  A text cannot optimized for all of them at the same time: dictionaries are not textbooks.

The goals of an RPG ruleset:

1. As a **reference** for the rules, structured to be easily searchable and written to be unambiguous.
2. As a **tutorial**, structured to guide a new reader and written to be accessible.
3. As an **inspiration** that evokes the fantasy that they want to emulate, and gets people excited.

The GLOG is slightly unique in the fact that it expects its DMs to chop it up, add, subtract, and homebrew.  So the GLOG has one additional goal:

4. As **empowerment** to get DMs into about game design, so that they will feel more comfortable hacking the ruleset, and be better at their homebrew once they do.

## Sidebars

The primary text of each section will be the simplest version of the best rules (IMO), I will also include collapsed sidebars for variants, discussion, and maybe even lore.

A group that just wants to play the Orthodox GLOG will never have to open these sidebars.  

A group that has no intention of ever playing the GLOG may still find these discussions to be the most useful part of this site.  Hopefully they'll inspire revisions of the reader's own homebrew, or at least provide elements worth stealing.

  One big advantage of a website is the ability to compress large discussions into collapsed sidebars.  While I've tried to keep the rest of the document succinct, sidebars allow me to rant longer before I start feeling the guilt of inefficiency.  If you aren't interested in the content of these sidebars, don't open them.

  <summary markdown='span'>Discussion: How to Disagree</summary>

  I'm writing about RPGs on the internet: I am fully aware that you are going to disagree with me. 

  You may be correct.  The GLOG is not the best system for *everyone*.  It's not even the best system for *anyone* (except me).  It is *a* optimum, not *the* optimum.  

  So if you see an error or an omission in the GLOG, let's talk about it.  BLOG about it.  Publish something.  Put out an alternative, and explain why it is preferable.  The stuff you write will not be The Optimum either, but a specific group with a specific set of needs may find it to be exactly the sort of thing that they needed.

  So even though you may dislike the GLOG, I hope you still find something worth stealing.  (That's kind of the point.)

  The only goblin law is that there are no goblin laws.
