# Introduction

This site is meant to serve as a central repository for the GLOG.

It will get written when I have time.  It will get updated whenever I have a better idea.  It will last until it has served its purpose.

## The True GLOG

The GLOG that can be written down is not the true GLOG.  

The GLOG is a set of interlocking system for running an RPG, but more importantly, it is a philosophy that will hopefully teach you to to be independent of the GLOG entirely.  Throughout this site, I will try to explain the design goals that led me to choose one sub-system over another.  Hopefully, as you learn why certain goals are better served by certain rules, you will make your own design decisions, and hack together your own game.  Eventually, you will not be playing the game described on this site.  You will be playing something much better.  

So that is why this is not the True GLOG.  Nothing is True.

## Purpose

All RPG rulebooks have multiple goals.  While these goals are not mutually exclusive, they are competitive.  A text cannot optimized for all of them at the same time: dictionaries are not textbooks.

The goals of an RPG ruleset:

1. As a **reference** for the rules, structured to be easily searchable and written to be unambiguous.
2. As a **tutorial**, structured to guide a new reader and written to be accessible.
3. As an **inspiration** that evokes the fantasy that they want to emulate, and gets people excited.
4. As **empowerment** to mutate DMs into game designers, so that they will be more comfortable with--and better at--hacking their own ruleset.

## Sidebars

The primary text of each section will be the simplest version of the best rules (IMO), I will also include collapsed sidebars for variants, discussion, and maybe even lore.

A group that just wants to play the Orthodox GLOG will never have to open these sidebars.  

A group that has no intention of ever playing the GLOG may still find these discussions to be the most useful part of this site.  Hopefully they'll inspire revisions of the reader's own homebrew, or at least provide elements worth stealing.

  One big advantage of a website is the ability to compress large discussions into collapsed sidebars.  While I've tried to keep the rest of the document succinct, sidebars allow me to rant longer before I start feeling the guilt of inefficiency.  If you aren't interested in the content of these sidebars, don't open them.

  <summary markdown='span'>Discussion: How to Disagree</summary>

  I'm writing about RPGs on the internet: I am fully aware that you are going to disagree with me. 

  You may be correct.  The GLOG is not the best system for *everyone*.  It's not even the best system for *anyone* (except me).  It is *a* optimum, not *the* optimum.  

  So if you see an error or an omission in the GLOG, let's talk about it.  BLOG about it.  Publish something.  Put out an alternative, and explain why it is preferable.  The stuff you write will not be The Optimum either, but a specific group with a specific set of needs may find it to be exactly the sort of thing that they needed.

  So even though you may dislike the GLOG, I hope you still find something worth stealing.  (That's kind of the point.)

  The only goblin law is that there are no goblin laws.
