# Hit Points

Hit points are best thought of as "don't get hit points".  They represent your ability to turn aside potentially lethal damage.  A bad fall turns into a scraped knee.  An arrow is caught by your shoulder instead of your heart.  Hit points aren't just a matter of physicality--they're made from determination, experience, and luck.  

Incoming damage is subtracted from your HP, all the way down to 0 HP.  There is no negative HP in the GLOG.  There are no penalties for being at 0 HP, but any further damage rolls over and becomes lethal damage.

If you cannot respond to incoming damage (perhaps you are tied up or asleep), then your HP is bypassed and any damage becomes lethal damage.

## Recovering HP

If you spend 20 minutes eating lunch, you will regain 1d6 HP.  A single ration is enough for the whole party (because an inventory slot is bigger than just one meal).

If the meal is gourmet, you regain 2d6 HP instead.  Gourmet meals are made from fresh, quality food and a successful cooking check.

You regain all of your HP by getting a good night's sleep.  This requires a ration and 8 hours of sleep.

Magical healing is also a thing that exists.

## Dying

Any damage that exceeds the capacity of your HP is lethal damage.  Lethal damage is subtracted from your Constitution as ability damage.  (Ability damage returns at a rate of 1 point per day.)

Then, you make a Con check.  If you roll equal-to-or-less than your new Constitution, you fall unconscious and can make a Con check at the start of every round to see if you wake up.

If you roll over your Constitution, it's time to roll on the Death and Dismemberment Table.

#### Dying

At the end of each turn, a dying character makes a Con check.

* Critical Success.  You wake up at 0 HP.  You feel terrible.  You should probably play dead.
* Success.  You remain unconscious.
* Failure.  You lose another point of Con.
* Fumble.  You die.

Allies can attempt to revive you by succeeding on an Int/2 check.  Anything that restores HP will also revive you.  Any further damage will kill you.

#### Trauma

You'll need to make a trauma check.  See also: Trauma and Madness.

#### Burned

Your maximum HP is permanently reduced by 2 until you can get some new skin.

#### Cursed

You gain a curse from the Random Curse Table.
