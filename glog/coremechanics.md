# The Core Mechanic

The core mechanic is a d20 roll-under-or-equal-to a target number.

On your character sheet, you'll have a Strength score.  To succeed on a Strength check, you need to roll a d20 and get equal-or-less than your Strength score.  So if your Strength is 12, you need to roll a 12 or less to succeed on a Strength check.  It doesn't take much math to figure out that you have a 60% chance of succeeding.

If you roll a natural 1, that is a critical success, and some good stuff is about to happen to you.  If you roll a natural 20, that is a critical fail, and all sorts of hell is about to rain down upon your head.

Pretty much everything works like this.

The players roll nearly all of the dice.  Are you attacking a monster?  Make an Attack roll.  Is a monster attacking you?  Make a Defense roll.
