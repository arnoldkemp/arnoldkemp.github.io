# The Core Mechanic

The core mechanic is a d20 roll-under-or-equal-to a target number somewhere on your character sheet, called a score.

On your character sheet, you'll have a Strength score.  To succeed on a Strength check, you need to roll a d20 and get equal-or-less than your Strength score.  So if your Strength is 12, you need to roll a 12 or less to succeed on a Strength check.  It doesn't take much math to figure out that you have a 60% chance of succeeding.

Easy checks give you a +4 bonus (treating your score as if it were 4 points higher) while Difficult checks give you a -4 bonus.

If you roll a natural 1, that is a critical success, and some good stuff is about to happen to you.  If you roll a natural 20, that is a critical fail, and all sorts of hell is about to rain down upon your head.

The players roll nearly all of the dice.  Are you attacking a monster?  Make an Attack roll.  Is a monster attacking you?  Make a Defense roll.

## Opposed Rolls

Opposed rolls are handled in much the same way.  A single roll is made against one player's score, modified up or down depending on their opponent.

If this is a contest between two players, let the underdog roll.  They get a 1 point penalty for every point their opponent's score exceeds 10, and similar bonus if their opponent's score is below 10.

For example, if a Str 13 Knight is going to wrestle a Str 15 Barbarian, the Knight makes a Strength check (normally requiring a 13 or less) with a 5 point penalty (because of the Barbarian's Strength).  In the end, the Knight needs to roll an 8 or less to succeed.

Opposed rolls don't happen very often.  Also note that you can use this method to back-calculate what a monster's character sheet would look like.

## Exceptions 

Magic Dice.  Encounter checks.  Damage rolls.
